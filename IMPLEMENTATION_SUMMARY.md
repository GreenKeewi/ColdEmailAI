## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Environment Variables Required
The application requires these environment variables to be set:
- Clerk authentication keys
- Supabase connection details
- OpenAI/Anthropic/GitHub Models API key
- Gmail OAuth credentials
- SendGrid API key
- Encryption key

Without these, the app will not build or run in production.

### Production Deployment Notes

2. Run database migrations in Supabase
3. Configure Gmail OAuth redirect URLs
4. Set up Clerk webhook endpoints for user sync
5. Configure SendGrid webhook for event tracking

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
- Automated follow-up sequences (scheduling)
- A/B testing for subject lines
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Email templates library
- Team collaboration features
- API rate limiting
- Background job queue (BullMQ already in dependencies)
